## 🚀 Executive Summary
FlowOpsAI is an **AI-powered MLOps orchestration platform** designed to simplify how enterprises manage machine learning workflows.  
It provides agent-driven automation for training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining of ML models — eliminating friction in traditional MLOps pipelines.

## 📌 Why FlowOpsAI?
- Traditional MLOps requires heavy **manual engineering** and fragmented tools.
- FlowOpsAI introduces **AI agents + orchestration** to automate repetitive tasks, manage pipelines, and provide insights.  
- It is designed to handle **large-scale LLMs, complex datasets, and long-term memory contexts**, making it future-proof.

## 🔄 How FlowOpsAI Works
- **Frontend (React + Nginx):** UI for workflows, chat, and monitoring.  
- **Backend (FastAPI + Postgres):** Core APIs, persistence, and agent coordination.  
- **Agents:** Automate workflow orchestration and training tasks.  
- **Trainer Service:** Runs and monitors training pipelines.  
- **Integrations:** Can plug into MCP servers, RAG pipelines, and n8n workflows.
